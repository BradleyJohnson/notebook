  - Various computer systems are designed for their expected use.
    - PCs/laptops are designed with the knowledge that they'll be mostly used by a single user.
      - ease of use is a high priority
      - no care for resource utilization / sharing
    - PCs/laptops were a sea change from the shared system model in the Unix days
    - Mobile devices have repeated this pattern wrt to PCs
  - Some systems have no user view.
